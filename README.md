# Sensing & Analytics Website

A single-page experience that highlights sensing, telemetry, and analytics capabilities for smart environments. The page showcases live-like signal cards, operational metrics, and automations.

## Getting started

Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the directory with any static file server, for example:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

## Structure

- `index.html` — page markup with hero, analytics cards, and automation callouts.
- `styles.css` — styling, layout, and responsive behavior.
- `script.js` — interactive range selector that swaps signals, metrics, and live events.
